# Github-Actions-Data
Github-Actions-Data will demonstrate how to work with data via Github actions. The actions in this repo will utilizing Job Artifacts and Outputs. 

**Job Artifacts:** The output or assets generated by a job. The work code written in the demo.yml file will demonstrate how to upload and download artfacts with jobs via the (actions/upload-artifact@v3 && actions/download-artifact@v3). The output of these steps are in the screen shot below. In addition to uploading and downloading the demo.yml file will also demonstrate how to access artifact data across different jobs.
__Upload Artifact: uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3__
Allows us to add data to the job by a defined step that will allow us to add artifacts (file data) via a specified path so that we can be able to access them independently.

__Download Artifact: uses: actions/download-artifact@v3__
Allows us to read artifact data across different jobs. We would need to specify the `- name:` from which the artifact was upload.

**Publish Artifact**
We defined a step witin the build job where given and `id` we would "publish" the artifact and expose it to the github context. This is done when we point the `outputs:` section to its value with in the step. It give us access to that data in a different. Below will show that we publish the artifact in the build step and was able to use it to echo the file name in the deploy job.
